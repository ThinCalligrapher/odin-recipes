        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Pizza, that elusive delicacy no one's ever heard of, finally has a recipe page — 
            because obviously bread, sauce, and cheese needed formal documentation. 
            Revered as the height of culinary complexity, it requires advanced skills like 
            “calling for delivery” or “opening the oven door.” Historians debate whether pizza 
            is actually food or just a socially acceptable excuse to stack random leftovers on 
            carbs, while scientists confirm its primary function is burning the roof of your 
            mouth on the first bite. Of course, it's also basically a salad — tomato sauce counts 
            as a vegetable, right? — and pepperoni is the kind of emotional support meat we can all 
            get behind

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza dough</li>
            <li>Marinara sauce</li>
            <li>Assorted cheeses</li>
            <li>Pepperoni</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h4><strong>Step 1</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Spread the pizza dough out by rolling it and tossing it. Use flour to prevent
            sticking to hands. Then add marinara, cheese, and toppings as desired.
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Pre heat an oven to 425 and bake on a pizza pan for 12-18 minutes. Remove
            when cheese starts to turn golden brown.
